SpeedAi Mobile Application may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules that accompany certain features, and these guidelines, terms, or rules will be published alongside such features on SpeedAi. All such additional terms, guides, and rules are incorporated into these terms by reference. These terms apply to all users and other individuals ("Users," "you," or, if applicable, "your users") accessing, downloading, installing, registering, or using SpeedAi, whether used by you or any users on your account (collectively, "your use" and "your users").

These Terms ("Terms") set forth legally binding terms and conditions that constrain your use of SpeedAi. By accessing or using SpeedAi, you (on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent) accept these Terms, and you represent and warrant that you (on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent) have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms, including that you have reached the legal age to enter into these Terms (usually at least 18 years old). If you or your users are under 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority where you or they reside), you or they may only use SpeedAi under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a user under 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority), you agree to be fully responsible for the user's actions and omissions in relation to SpeedAi. If you do not agree with all the provisions of these Terms, please do not access and/or use SpeedAi or allow other users to access and/or use it.

Please be aware that Section 10.2 of these terms contains provisions regarding the resolution of disputes between you and us, including but not limited to any dispute that arises or is asserted before the effective date of your acceptance of these terms. Specifically, it includes an arbitration agreement that, with limited exceptions, requires binding, final arbitration of disputes between us. Unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement: (1) you may only bring disputes or claims against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding, and (2) you waive the right to seek relief in court for disputes or claims and the right to have disputes or claims decided by a judge or jury, except as otherwise provided in the arbitration agreement.

Such Third-Party Links and Advertisements are not under the control of the company, and the company is not responsible for any Third-Party Links and Advertisements. The provision of access to these Third-Party Links and Advertisements is for your convenience only, and the company does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, guarantee, or make any representations regarding Third-Party Links and Advertisements. You use all Third-Party Links and Advertisements at your own risk, and appropriate caution and judgment should be applied when doing so.

Before engaging in any transactions related to such Third-Party Links and Advertisements, you should conduct any investigation you deem necessary or appropriate.

    4.2 Other Users: Each SpeedAi user is solely responsible for any and all User Content of their own. As we do not control User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content, whether provided by you or others. We do not guarantee the accuracy, utility, applicability, or quality of any User Content. Your interactions with other SpeedAi users are limited to you and those users. You agree that the company is not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any such interactions. In case of a dispute between you and any SpeedAi user, we have no obligation to intervene.

    4.3 Release: You hereby release and forever discharge the company (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from all past, present, and future liabilities, disputes, claims, controversies, demands, rights, obligations, responsibilities, lawsuits, and causes of action (including for personal injury, death, and property damage) of every kind and nature, whether directly or indirectly arising out of, or in any way related to, SpeedAi (including interactions with other SpeedAi users or any Third-Party Links and Advertisements). If you are a resident of California, you specifically waive the provisions of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."

    4.4 Waiver: SpeedAi may be changed at any time in any way at the company's sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, updates and discontinuation of previously available features. We make no guarantees regarding the quality, reliability, or uptime of SpeedAi.

We (and our suppliers) do not guarantee that SpeedAi will meet your requirements, be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free, or that SpeedAi will be accurate, reliable, free of viruses or other harmful code, complete, legal, or safe. If applicable law requires any warranties for SpeedAi, all such warranties are limited to ninety (90) days from the first use.

    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on the duration of implied warranties, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

    4.5 Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the company (or our suppliers) be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, data loss, costs of procurement of substitute products, or any indirect, consequential, punitive, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising from or related to these terms or your use or inability to use SpeedAi, even if the company has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Your access and use of SpeedAi are at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your device or computer system or any loss of data resulting therefrom.

    To the maximum extent permitted by law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, our liability to you for any damages arising from or related to these terms (regardless of the form of action or claim) will at all times be limited to the greater of fifty US dollars ($50) or the aggregate amount you have paid to us in the last twelve (12) months. The existence of multiple claims will not enlarge this limit. You agree that our suppliers have no liability for these terms.

    Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

    4.6 Term and Termination: These terms will remain in full force and effect as long as you use SpeedAi. We may suspend or terminate your right to use SpeedAi (including your account) at any time for any reason, including for violating these terms using SpeedAi. Once your rights under these terms are terminated, your account and the right to access and use SpeedAi will immediately cease. You understand that the termination of your account may involve the removal of user content associated with your account from our live databases. For any termination of your rights under these terms, including the termination of your account or the deletion of your user content, the company is not liable. The following provisions of these terms will remain effective even after the termination of your rights under these terms: Sections 2.2 to 2.8, and Sections 3 to 10.

    4.7 Copyright Policy: The company respects the intellectual property rights of others and requires users of SpeedAi to do the same. Regarding SpeedAi, we have implemented and enforce a policy that respects copyright law, which includes removing any infringing materials and, in appropriate circumstances, terminating SpeedAi users who repeatedly infringe intellectual property rights (including copyrights). If you believe that one of our users has unlawfully infringed on the copyrights of a work by using SpeedAi and you wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, you must provide the following information in writing to our designated copyright agent (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 512(c))

    4.8 Changes: These terms may be revised from time to time, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending an email to the last email address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting a notice of the changes on SpeedAi. You are responsible for providing us with your most current email address. If your last provided email address is invalid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering the above notice to you, our dispatch of an email containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Your continued use of SpeedAi following such notice of changes will indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound by the modified terms and conditions.

5. Dispute Resolution

    5.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement: Please carefully read Section 10.2 (sometimes referred to as the "Arbitration Agreement"). This is part of your contract with the company and affects your rights. It includes procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and waiver of class action relief for all claims and disputes related to these terms or the use of any products or services provided by the company (excluding claims or other equitable relief for the provision of services). Unless otherwise agreed, all arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. This arbitration agreement applies to you and the company, as well as any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the services or goods provided under these terms.

    5.2 Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution: Before either party seeks arbitration, that party must first send to the other party a written notice of the dispute ("Notice"). The Notice should describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. Notices to the company should be sent to: 1201 Second Avenue, Suite 2601, Seattle, WA 98101. After receiving the Notice, you and the company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration. No disclosure of any settlement amount proposed by either party shall be made to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which a party is entitled.

    You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

    5.3 Powers of the Arbitrator: The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the company. The arbitration proceedings will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the power to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and provide any non-monetary remedy or relief available under applicable law, the arbitral tribunal rules, and these terms (including the arbitration agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitration award is final and binding on both you and us.

    5.4 Waiver of Jury Trial: You and the company hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Instead, you and the company choose to have all disputes, claims, or requests for relief resolved through arbitration as per this arbitration agreement, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court could, and must honor the terms of these terms. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.

    5.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief: All disputes, claims, and requests for relief within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis, and not on a class or collective basis, and only individual relief is available. A claim by, or on behalf of, one customer or user can't be arbitrated or litigated with the claims of any other customer or user. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law prohibits enforcement of any limitation in this Section concerning a specific dispute, claim, or request for relief, that aspect must be severed from arbitration and brought into the state or federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.

    5.6 Severability: Except as provided in Section 10.2.6 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable under the law, that specific part shall be deemed invalid and severed, while the remaining provisions of the arbitration agreement shall continue in full force.

    5.7 Survival of the Agreement: This arbitration agreement will continue to be effective even after the termination of your relationship with the company.

    5.8 Export: SpeedAi may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export and import regulations of other countries, including the Export Administration Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, sanctions maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State. You agree not to violate any U.S. export laws or regulations, directly or indirectly export, re-export, or transfer any U.S. technical data obtained from the company or any products utilizing such data. You represent and warrant that you (a) are not located in a country or region subject to U.S. government embargo, and (b) are not a denied party as specified in the above regulations.

    5.9 Electronic Communications: Whether you use SpeedAi or send us emails, and whether the company provides notices on SpeedAi or communicates with you via email, you and the company consent to the electronic communication. For contractual purposes, you (a) agree to receive communications from the company in electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications provided to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in hard copy. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.

    5.10 Government Terms: We provide SpeedAi, including related software and technology, for ultimate federal government use. If you are any government agency, department, or other entity, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of any kind of SpeedAi, including related documentation (technical data, software, and manuals), is restricted by these terms. All other use is prohibited, and no rights are granted except as provided in these terms. SpeedAi is entirely privately funded.

    5.11 Entire Agreement: These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of SpeedAi. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The term "including" means "including but not limited to." If any provision of these terms is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent allowed by law. Your relationship with the company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. You may not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these terms or your rights and obligations under this agreement without the company's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The company may freely assign these terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these terms shall be binding upon assignees.

    5.12 Copyright/Trademark Information: You may not use these marks without our prior written permission or the permission of the third party that may own these marks.
