   <p>We aim to help you understand how Speed AI handles your personal data and the choices you have in managing your
      data. It is crucial to know how Speed AI protects your images. You can find all this information in our privacy
      policy.</p>
   <p>The following key points highlight some essential details about the application and our security measures:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>Speed AI is a photo and video editing application. It enhances photos and videos by improving aspects such as
         image resolution and color. Additionally, it allows you to generate new images using artificial intelligence.
      </li>
      <li>The photo and video editing, enhancement, and generation technologies of Speed AI do not engage in facial
         recognition activities. These technologies do not attempt or permit the identification or verification of
         individuals in the images.</li>
      <li>Speed AI is just a photo and video editing application that never collects any user data (including facial
         data) and will only generate new images based on user-uploaded images at the user&#39;s request.</li>
      <li>When you agree to use Speed AI to use artificial intelligence to re-edit the pictures, videos, recordings you
         upload, and the pictures generated by the application (such as enhanced photos, AI pictures), the new pictures
         and videos will never be stored, and will not be stored until you do not All data is destroyed immediately
         after downloading and returning to the previous level of the application. Or destroyed in real time after you
         download it instantly. Speed AI does not have the rights or resources to save any data.</li>
      <li>Speed AI never shares any data with any third party, nor does it save any data. All data transmission or
         artificial intelligence generation based on user requests will be destroyed in real time unless the user
         downloads it immediately.</li>
      <li>You retain control over the images you upload, enhance, and generate with Speed AI. We do not sell, trade, or
         claim ownership of any of your images, whether you use Speed AI to edit existing images or generate new ones.
      </li>
      <li>Speed AI does not require you to provide any registration materials, nor perform any registration options. If
         there is any future, we will modify these regulations.</li>
      <li>Unless you explicitly choose to opt in, your images will not be used to train our artificial intelligence
         technologies.</li>
      <li>Your images will be protected by appropriate security measures and in compliance with privacy and data
         protection laws and industry standards. This includes encryption for enhanced security.</li>

   <h2 id="data-types-data-usage-and-retention-activities-performed-by-default-when-using-the-application">Data Types,
      Data Usage, and Retention - Activities Performed by Default When Using the Application</h2>
   <p>When you use our application, the following activities are consistently carried out. This means that if you decide
      to access the application and utilize its features, your personal data will be used for the purposes listed in
      this section. If you choose not to provide personal data, you may be unable to use the application.</p>
   <h3 id="1-service-delivery">1. Service Delivery</h3>
   <p>We use your personal data to enable you to use the application and provide you with its functionalities. Examples
      of using the application include editing and enhancing your photos and videos, as well as generating your own AI
      images. Functionality provided includes showing you information about the application and the editing process, as
      well as offering suggestions on the best photos to edit.</p>
   <h4 id="a-data-categories-use-of-the-following-data">a. Data Categories: Use of the Following Data</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>User Identifiers: (e.g., Apple ID) and mobile identifiers (e.g., IP address, device identifier, and custom
         identifiers generated by us for user identification).</li>
      <li>Device Information: (e.g., device model, device type, operating system version, device language, device name,
         and region).</li>
      <li>Subscription Information: Information related to your subscription.</li>
      <li>Interaction with the Application: Information about your interactions with the application.</li>
      <li>Uploaded Images, Videos, Recordings, and Generated Images: (e.g., enhanced photos, AI images) To edit photos
         and videos or generate AI images, the application needs access to your gallery and camera. You must explicitly
         allow this access through the request pop-up displayed on your mobile device.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Age: (Only when necessary to provide requested features, such as the aging video feature)</p>
   <h4 id="b-face-data-handling">b. Face Data Handling</h4>
   <p>The images and videos you upload may contain human faces. In this case, we process certain information about the
      face (e.g., information to estimate the location of facial features). This information is called &quot;face
      data&quot; or &quot;face data&quot;. Facial data may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions outside
      Asia and Europe. However, the technology implemented in the application does not allow for unique identification
      or authentication of people in images, nor have we trained our technology to do this. We only use the application
      to create the requested AI images based on the images you upload.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Any relevant data (including facial data) will not be intentionally collected or stored.</li>
      <li>The application only performs artificial intelligence editing on the data containing facial information
         uploaded based on user requests to generate new images, and does not perform any other operations.</li>
      <li>As the main function of the application, artificial intelligence image editing will respond to user requests
         to generate new artificial intelligence images based on images. Such images are only for users to download and
         save by themselves, and the application will never collect or save them.</li>
      <li>All data (including images, videos and other facial data information that users agree to upload) will not be
         shared with any third party.</li>
      <li>All data (including images, videos and other facial data information that users agree to upload) will not be
         collected and saved. The application automatically destroys all data immediately after the user returns one
         level in the application or after the user downloads an image.</li>
   </ul>
   <h4 id="c-legal-basis">c. Legal Basis</h4>
   <p>These activities are based on the contracts we enter into with you. When you use the aging video feature, we
      require your consent as the responsible parent to process personal data related to children in the images you
      upload to generate videos.</p>
