   <p>Last Revised: December 31, 2023</p>
   <p>GraphixAi Mobile Application may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules that accompany certain
      features, and these guidelines, terms, or rules will be published alongside such features on GraphixAi. All such
      additional terms, guides, and rules are incorporated into these terms by reference. These terms apply to all users
      and other individuals (&quot;Users,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; or, if applicable, &quot;your users&quot;) accessing,
      downloading, installing, registering, or using GraphixAi, whether used by you or any users on your account
      (collectively, &quot;your use&quot; and &quot;your users&quot;).</p>
   <p>These Terms (&quot;Terms&quot;) set forth legally binding terms and conditions that constrain your use of
      GraphixAi. By accessing or using GraphixAi, you (on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent) accept these
      Terms, and you represent and warrant that you (on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent) have the right,
      authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms, including that you have reached the legal age to enter into
      these Terms (usually at least 18 years old). If you or your users are under 18 years old (or the applicable age of
      majority where you or they reside), you or they may only use GraphixAi under the supervision of a parent or legal
      guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a user under 18 years
      old (or the applicable age of majority), you agree to be fully responsible for the user&#39;s actions and
      omissions in relation to GraphixAi. If you do not agree with all the provisions of these Terms, please do not
      access and/or use GraphixAi or allow other users to access and/or use it.</p>
   <p>Please be aware that Section 10.2 of these terms contains provisions regarding the resolution of disputes between
      you and us, including but not limited to any dispute that arises or is asserted before the effective date of your
      acceptance of these terms. Specifically, it includes an arbitration agreement that, with limited exceptions,
      requires binding, final arbitration of disputes between us. Unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement: (1)
      you may only bring disputes or claims against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any
      class or representative action or proceeding, and (2) you waive the right to seek relief in court for disputes or
      claims and the right to have disputes or claims decided by a judge or jury, except as otherwise provided in the
      arbitration agreement.</p>

      <li>
         <p>Accounts</p>
         <p> 1.1 Account Creation. </p>
         <p> To utilize certain features of GraphixAi, you must register an account (&quot;Account&quot;) and provide
            specific information as prompted by the account registration form. You declare and warrant that: (a) all
            required registration information you submit is true and accurate, and (b) you will maintain the accuracy of
            such information. You may, at any time and for any reason, delete your Account following the instructions on
            GraphixAi. The company reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account in accordance with Section 8.
            If your registration uses a third-party account, you agree to allow us access to that third-party account as
            permitted by the applicable terms and conditions of that third party. Special account requirements apply to
            certain employees and business purposes as specified in Section 1.3.</p>
         <p> 1.2 Customer Responsibilities</p>
         <p> Account Security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login information
            and bear full responsibility for all activities occurring under your account. You agree to promptly notify
            the company of any unauthorized use or suspected unauthorized use of your account or any other security
            breach. The company assumes no liability for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to comply with
            the above requirements.</p>
         <p> 1.3 Employee or Corporate Accounts</p>

         <p> If you provide any feedback or suggestions (&quot;Feedback&quot;) to the company regarding GraphixAi, you
            hereby transfer all rights in such Feedback to the company and agree that the company has the right to use

         <p> 2.9 Purchases and Subscriptions</p>
         <p> Some features and usage of GraphixAi are free. We also offer paid subscriptions for certain enhanced
            services and additional features (&quot;Purchased Features&quot;). You may purchase Purchased Features
            through third parties such as the Apple App Store or Google Play, or directly through the GraphixAi website.
            If you purchase Purchased Features from a third party, in addition to these terms, separate terms and
            conditions with that third party may apply. If you purchase Purchased Features on a subscription basis (a
            &quot;Paid Subscription&quot;) on top of a subscription, the fees you pay for such Purchased Features will
            automatically renew and continue until termination. You must cancel the Paid Subscription before renewal to
            avoid payment for the next billing cycle. We reserve the right to modify, terminate, or otherwise amend our
            subscription plans, pricing, and Purchased Features offered at any time. If applicable, please contact the
            third party (Apple App Store or Google Play support) for refunds or management of your Purchased Features.
            We cannot view, access, or modify any financial transactions for in-app subscriptions to Google. Instead,
            please contact the appropriate support team for Apple or Google LLC related to your Paid Subscription for a
            refund. You can cancel a Paid Subscription by logging into your account and following the instructions for
            canceling a Paid Subscription. If purchased through Google in-app subscription or purchase, learn more about
            Google Play refunds, and apply for an Apple in-app subscription or purchase refund.</p>
         <p> 2.10 Custom Features</p>
         <p> We may from time to time offer specific features or usage of GraphixAi that includes custom features
            (&quot;Custom Features&quot;). &quot;Custom Features&quot; refer to any and all features, functions, machine
            learning models, or any artificial intelligence technology provided to you or used in the creation of any
            GraphixAi content that is customized or developed in any way based on your requests or demands. You
            acknowledge and agree that Custom Features shall be the exclusive property of the company. Notwithstanding
            any contrary provisions in these terms, in no event shall (a) any Custom Feature or any part thereof be
            considered a &quot;work made for hire&quot; under the Copyright Act of 1976, or in any way exclusive to you,
            (b) you have any rights, ownership, or interests in any Custom Feature, except for the limited rights
            expressly granted in these terms. Custom Features and any part thereof are licensed to you only as per

            are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of User Content. In these terms,

            California Consumer Privacy Act, which may be revised from time to time.</p>
         <p> 3.2 License: You acknowledge and agree that over time, you will benefit from our ability to improve
            GraphixAi. You hereby grant to the company and its successors and assigns an irrevocable, perpetual,
            non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, global license to copy, distribute, store, transfer, publicly
            display and perform, prepare derivative works, merge into other works, and otherwise use and exploit your
            User Content and the content you generate. You also grant the above rights as sublicenses for the purpose of
            including and using your User Content and the content you generate in its business operations (including
            developing and improving GraphixAi). Provided that if such User Content is your limited use content (defined
            below), (I) such business operations shall be limited to providing GraphixAi and its features to you, and
            (ii) any public display or distribution shall be under your guidance or with your prior consent. You hereby
            irrevocably waive (and agree to waive) any claims and assertions related to moral rights or ownership
            associated with your User Content and the content you generate.</p>
         <p> 3.3 Acceptable Use Policy: The following terms constitute our &quot;Acceptable Use Policy&quot;:</p>

            the regulations, policies, or procedures of such networks; (v) attempt to unauthorized access GraphixAi (or
            any other computer systems or networks connected or used with GraphixAi), whether through password mining or
            any other means; (vi) harass or disrupt any other user&#39;s use and enjoyment of GraphixAi; or (vii) create
            multiple accounts on GraphixAi using software or automated proxies or scripts, or generate automated
            searches, requests, or queries on GraphixAi or extract, scrape, or mine data from GraphixAi in any manner or
            by any means.</p>
         <p> 3.4 Enforcement; Generated Content: We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to review, refuse, and/or
            remove any User Content or GraphixAi Content if you violate the acceptable use policy or any other
            provisions of these terms or otherwise cause liability to us or any other person. We have the right to
            investigate and/or take appropriate action against you. Such actions may include deleting or modifying your
            User Content, any GraphixAi Content affected by your actions, terminating your account pursuant to Section
            8, and/or reporting you to law enforcement. While we make efforts to ensure that GraphixAi Content complies
            with the content policy, certain GraphixAi Content is generated using artificial intelligence technology
            based on user content under the user&#39;s guidance</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Third-Party Links and Advertisements</p>
         <p> 4.1 Third-Party Links and Advertisements: GraphixAi may contain links to third-party websites and services
            and/or display advertisements for third parties (collectively referred to as &quot;Third-Party Links and
            Advertisements&quot;). Such Third-Party Links and Advertisements are not under the control of the company,
            and the company is not responsible for any Third-Party Links and Advertisements. The provision of access to
            these Third-Party Links and Advertisements is for your convenience only, and the company does not review,
            approve, monitor, endorse, guarantee, or make any representations regarding Third-Party Links and
            Advertisements. You use all Third-Party Links and Advertisements at your own risk, and appropriate caution
            and judgment should be applied when doing so. When you click on any Third-Party Links and Advertisements,
            the applicable third-party terms and policies, including the privacy and data collection practices of the
            third party, apply. Before engaging in any transactions related to such Third-Party Links and
            Advertisements, you should conduct any investigation you deem necessary or appropriate.</p>
         <p> 4.2 Other Users: Each GraphixAi user is solely responsible for any and all User Content of their own. As we
            do not control User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content,
            whether provided by you or others. We do not guarantee the accuracy, utility, applicability, or quality of
            any User Content. Your interactions with other GraphixAi users are limited to you and those users. You agree
            that the company is not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any such interactions. In case of
            a dispute between you and any GraphixAi user, we have no obligation to intervene.</p>
         <p> 4.3 Release: You hereby release and forever discharge the company (and our officers, employees, agents,
            successors, and assigns) from all past, present, and future liabilities, disputes, claims, controversies,
            demands, rights, obligations, responsibilities, lawsuits, and causes of action (including for personal
            injury, death, and property damage) of every kind and nature, whether directly or indirectly arising out of,
            or in any way related to, GraphixAi (including interactions with other GraphixAi users or any Third-Party
            Links and Advertisements). If you are a resident of California, you specifically waive the provisions of
            Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which states: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims
            that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
            executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement
            with the debtor or released party.&quot;</p>
         <p> 4.4 Waiver: GraphixAi may be changed at any time in any way at the company&#39;s sole discretion. This
            includes, but is not limited to, updates and discontinuation of previously available features. We make no
            guarantees regarding the quality, reliability, or uptime of GraphixAi. For laws that may apply to you, we
            make no representations or warranties, including ownership of the content you generate if you maintain a
            paid subscription. We advise against relying on GraphixAi or creating any dependencies related to GraphixAi
            in any way. You acknowledge and agree that: (a) we are not liable for any damages to you, your clients, or
            any third party resulting from your reliance or reliance on GraphixAi; (b) you are solely responsible for
            determining the legality of your use and redistribution of GraphixAi Content.</p>
         <p> GraphixAi is provided on an &quot;as-is&quot; and &quot;as-available&quot; basis, and the company (and our
            suppliers) explicitly disclaim any and all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied, or
            statutory, including warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title,
            quiet enjoyment, accuracy, or non-infringement. We (and our suppliers) do not guarantee that GraphixAi will
            meet your requirements, be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free, or that GraphixAi will be accurate,
            reliable, free of viruses or other harmful code, complete, legal, or safe. If applicable law requires any
            warranties for GraphixAi, all such warranties are limited to ninety (90) days from the first use.</p>
         <p> Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply
            to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on the duration of implied warranties, so the above
            limitation may not apply to you.</p>
         <p> 4.5 Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the company (or our
            suppliers) be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, data loss, costs of procurement of
            substitute products, or any indirect, consequential, punitive, incidental, special, or punitive damages
            arising from or related to these terms or your use or inability to use GraphixAi, even if the company has
            been advised of the possibility of such damages. Your access and use of GraphixAi are at your own discretion
            and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your device or computer system or any loss of
            data resulting therefrom.</p>
         <p> To the maximum extent permitted by law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, our
            liability to you for any damages arising from or related to these terms (regardless of the form of action or
            claim) will at all times be limited to the greater of fifty US dollars ($50) or the aggregate amount you
            have paid to us in the last twelve (12) months. The existence of multiple claims will not enlarge this
            limit. You agree that our suppliers have no liability for these terms.</p>
         <p> Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential
            damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
         <p> 4.6 Term and Termination: These terms will remain in full force and effect as long as you use GraphixAi. We
            may suspend or terminate your right to use GraphixAi (including your account) at any time for any reason,
            including for violating these terms using GraphixAi. Once your rights under these terms are terminated, your
            account and the right to access and use GraphixAi will immediately cease. You understand that the
            termination of your account may involve the removal of user content associated with your account from our
            live databases. For any termination of your rights under these terms, including the termination of your
            account or the deletion of your user content, the company is not liable. The following provisions of these
            terms will remain effective even after the termination of your rights under these terms: Sections 2.2 to
            2.8, and Sections 3 to 10.</p>
         <p> 4.7 Copyright Policy: The company respects the intellectual property rights of others and requires users of
            GraphixAi to do the same. Regarding GraphixAi, we have implemented and enforce a policy that respects
            copyright law, which includes removing any infringing materials and, in appropriate circumstances,
            terminating GraphixAi users who repeatedly infringe intellectual property rights (including copyrights). If
            you believe that one of our users has unlawfully infringed on the copyrights of a work by using GraphixAi
            and you wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, you must provide the following information
            in writing to our designated copyright agent (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 512(c))</p>
         <p> 4.8 Changes: These terms may be revised from time to time, and if we make any substantial changes, we may
            notify you by sending an email to the last email address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently
            posting a notice of the changes on GraphixAi. You are responsible for providing us with your most current
            email address. If your last provided email address is invalid, or for any reason is not capable of
            delivering the above notice to you, our dispatch of an email containing such notice will nonetheless
            constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Your continued use of GraphixAi
            following such notice of changes will indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound
            by the modified terms and conditions.</p>

         <p>Dispute Resolution</p>
         <p> 5.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement: Please carefully read Section 10.2 (sometimes referred to as
            the &quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot;). This is part of your contract with the company and affects your
            rights. It includes procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and waiver of class action relief for all
            claims and disputes related to these terms or the use of any products or services provided by the company
            (excluding claims or other equitable relief for the provision of services). Unless otherwise agreed, all
            arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. This arbitration agreement applies to you and the
            company, as well as any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors,
            and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the services or goods
            provided under these terms.</p>
         <p> 5.2 Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution: Before either party seeks arbitration, that party must first
            send to the other party a written notice of the dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice should describe the
            nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. Notices to the company should be
            sent to: 1201 Second Avenue, Suite 2601, Seattle, WA 98101. After receiving the Notice, you and the company
            may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the company do not resolve the claim or
            dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration. No
            disclosure of any settlement amount proposed by either party shall be made to the arbitrator until after the
            arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which a party is entitled.</p>
         <p> You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person
            in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by
            the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
         <p> 5.3 Powers of the Arbitrator: The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and
            enforceability of this arbitration agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
            applicability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including but not limited to any
            claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide
            the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the company. The arbitration proceedings will not be
            consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the
            power to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
            award monetary damages and provide any non-monetary remedy or relief available under applicable law, the
            arbitral tribunal rules, and these terms (including the arbitration agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a
            written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award
            is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
            relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitration award is final and
            binding on both you and us.</p>
         <p> 5.4 Waiver of Jury Trial: You and the company hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue
            in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Instead, you and the company choose to have all
            disputes, claims, or requests for relief resolved through arbitration as per this arbitration agreement,
            except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator can
            award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court could, and must honor the terms of
            these terms. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
            limited.</p>
         <p> 5.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief: All disputes, claims, and requests for relief
            within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis, and not on a class
            or collective basis, and only individual relief is available. A claim by, or on behalf of, one customer or
            user can&#39;t be arbitrated or litigated with the claims of any other customer or user. If a decision is
            issued stating that applicable law prohibits enforcement of any limitation in this Section concerning a
            specific dispute, claim, or request for relief, that aspect must be severed from arbitration and brought
            into the state or federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. All other disputes,
            claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p>
         <p> 5.6 Severability: Except as provided in Section 10.2.6 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized
            Relief), if any part of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable under the law, that
            specific part shall be deemed invalid and severed, while the remaining provisions of the arbitration
            agreement shall continue in full force.</p>
         <p> 5.7 Survival of the Agreement: This arbitration agreement will continue to be effective even after the
            termination of your relationship with the company.</p>
         <p> 5.8 Export: GraphixAi may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export and import
            regulations of other countries, including the Export Administration Regulations maintained by the U.S.
            Department of Commerce, sanctions maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department
            of the Treasury, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of
            State. You agree not to violate any U.S. export laws or regulations, directly or indirectly export,
            re-export, or transfer any U.S. technical data obtained from the company or any products utilizing such
            data. You represent and warrant that you (a) are not located in a country or region subject to U.S.
            government embargo, and (b) are not a denied party as specified in the above regulations.</p>
         <p> 5.9 Electronic Communications: Whether you use GraphixAi or send us emails, and whether the company
            provides notices on GraphixAi or communicates with you via email, you and the company consent to the
            electronic communication. For contractual purposes, you (a) agree to receive communications from the company
            in electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other
            communications provided to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would
            satisfy if it were in hard copy. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.</p>
         <p> 5.10 Government Terms: We provide GraphixAi, including related software and technology, for ultimate
            federal government use. If you are any government agency, department, or other entity, the use, duplication,
            reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of any kind of GraphixAi, including related
            documentation (technical data, software, and manuals), is restricted by these terms. All other use is
            prohibited, and no rights are granted except as provided in these terms. GraphixAi is entirely privately
            funded.</p>
         <p> 5.11 Entire Agreement: These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of
            GraphixAi. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not operate as a
            waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these terms are for convenience only and have no
            legal or contractual effect. The term &quot;including&quot; means &quot;including but not limited to.&quot;
            If any provision of these terms is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be
            deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent allowed by law. Your relationship
            with the company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the
            other. You may not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these terms or your rights and
            obligations under this agreement without the company&#39;s prior written consent, and any attempted
            assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The
            company may freely assign these terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these terms shall be binding
            upon assignees.</p>
         <p> 5.12 Copyright/Trademark Information: You may not use these marks without our prior written permission or
            the permission of the third party that may own these marks.</p>
