   <h1 id="private-policy">PRIVATE POLICY</h1>
   <p>Welcome to GraphixAi Services</p>
   <p>Welcome to the services of GraphixAi. When you use our services, you trust us and provide us with your
      information. Therefore, we have established a privacy policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transmit,
      and store your information. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with our privacy policy, and if you have
      any questions, please let us know.</p>
   <h2 id="1-information-collection">1. Information Collection</h2>
   <p>A. The data we collect depends on your interaction with us, your choices (including your privacy settings), and
      the products and features you use. The data we collect may include SDK/API/JS code versions, browsers, internet
      service providers, IP addresses, platforms, timestamps, application identifiers, application versions, application
      distribution channels, unique device identifiers, ad identifiers (IDFA), Android ad identifiers, MAC addresses,
      and International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), device models, terminal manufacturers, terminal device
      operating system versions, session start/stop times, language, location, time zone, and network status (WiFi,
      etc.).</p>
   <p>B.In the process of obtaining your consent to use the application, we will ask if you agree to access the local
      media library and provide explanations for the purpose. After your agreement, some images containing facial
      information may be used. We promise:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>B1: We will never save any images containing facial information or any media information and materials you
         interact with during the use process.</li>
      <li>B2: We will only temporarily transmit these media information materials during your interaction with the
         application. After each interaction stops, all relevant information will be immediately deleted unless you
         choose to save it to your local media library. The application and any third party will not temporarily or
         permanently store this information.</li>
      <li>B3: This application provides AI image generation and optimization services, so after your consent, some media
         materials containing facial information may be used. These media materials may be used in collaboration with
         third parties to meet your needs, but we and any third party will immediately delete all relevant information
         after the interaction ends. Therefore, if necessary, you must choose to save it to your local media library.
      </li>
      <li>B4: We ensure that we and any third parties cooperating with us will not store or use any media information,
         whether or not it contains facial information. All relevant information will be deleted immediately after the
         interaction stops.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2 id="2-use-of-personal-information">2. Use of Personal Information</h2>
   <p>For example, some of our services may require you to register a social media account or phone number. When you do
      so, we will ask you to provide personal information such as your email address, phone number, to be stored in your
      account. If you wish to fully utilize the sharing features we provide, we may also ask you to register a Facebook
      account or phone number, which may include your Facebook name and photos.</p>
   <p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to enable you to access your personal information. If the information is
      incorrect, we will make efforts to provide you with a quick method for updating or deleting that information
      unless we are required to retain it for legitimate business or legal purposes.</p>
   <p>We aim to maintain our services in a way that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
      Therefore, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our
      active servers, nor will we remove information from our backup systems.</p>
   <h2 id="3-sharing-personal-data">3. Sharing Personal Data</h2>
   <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of GraphixAi unless
      one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <p>With your consent: After obtaining your consent, we will share personal information with companies,
            organizations, or individuals outside of GraphixAi. For the sharing of any sensitive personal information,
            we will require your explicit consent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>For external processing: We may share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals
            outside of GraphixAi if we have a reasonable belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the
            information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Comply with any applicable laws, regulations, legal procedures, or enforceable governmental requests.
            </li>
            <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigating potential violations.</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Protect our, our users&#39;, or the public&#39;s rights, property, or safety as required or permitted by
               law.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>We do not publicly disclose non-personal information and do not share it with our partners such as publishers,
      advertisers, or affiliated websites.</p>
   <p>We share personal data with vendors or agents who work on our behalf for the purposes described in this privacy
      policy. For example, companies we hire to provide data analysis services may need to collect and access personal
      data to provide these functions. In such cases, these companies must comply with our data privacy and security
      requirements.</p>
   <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any
      personal information and notify affected users before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to
      different privacy policies.</p>
   <h2 id="4-information-security-">4. Information Security:</h2>
   <p>We strive to protect both GraphixAi and our users from unauthorized access, unauthorized modification, disclosure,
      or destruction of the information we hold. Specifically:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>We use SSL encryption for many of our services.</li>
      <li>We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures,
         to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
      <li>We limit access to personal information to GraphixAi employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that
         information to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.
         Failure to fulfill these obligations may result in disciplinary action or termination.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2 id="5-international-transfer-of-personal-data-">5. International Transfer of Personal Data:</h2>
   <p>Our business may require us to transfer your personal data to countries such as the People&#39;s Republic of China
      or Singapore. We will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipients of your personal data comply with
      confidentiality obligations and security requirements.</p>
   <h2 id="6-changes-and-updates-to-this-policy-">6. Changes and Updates to this Policy:</h2>
   <p>We may occasionally update this policy. When we do so, we will also modify the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at
      the bottom of the policy. Your continued use of the services after the effective date of the revised policy
      indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to the current version of the policy. If we make changes to
      this policy in a manner that substantially reduces our use or disclosure of your personal information, we will
      make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and obtain your consent before applying the changes to any
      personal information we collected from you before the changes took effect. For example, we may send a message to
      your email address (if we have one on file), send a notification through the services, or generate a pop-up window
      or similar notification the first time you access the services after such significant changes. Major changes to
      this policy will be effective earlier of (I) your actual knowledge of such changes when you first use any services
      or (ii) 30 days after providing you notice of such changes as described in this section. We encourage you to
      regularly review this policy to understand how we collect, use, and disclose information.</p>
   <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information, and we empower you to
      control it all.</p>
