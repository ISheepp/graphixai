      Data Usage, and Retention - Activities Performed by Default When Using the Application</h2>
   <p>When you use our application, the following activities are consistently carried out. This means that if you decide
      to access the application and utilize its features, your personal data will be used for the purposes listed in

      <li>Uploaded Images, Videos, Recordings, and Generated Images: (e.g., enhanced photos, AI images) To edit photos
         and videos or generate AI images, the application needs access to your gallery and camera. You must explicitly
         allow this access through the request pop-up displayed on your mobile device.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Age: (Only when necessary to provide requested features, such as the aging video feature)</p>
   <h4 id="b-face-data-handling">b. Face Data Handling</h4>

      upload.</p>
   <h4 id="c-legal-basis">c. Legal Basis</h4>
